# MyWebDeveloperPortfolio

This is my main web developer portfolio. I hope you will enjoy and will contact me if you need me.

## Technologies:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Media queries**
- **JS**
- **Git**
- **Command Lines**
- **WireFrame**

## Project Goals:

## `For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.`

## Project Objectives:

1. **Build a website using HTML, CSS**
2. **Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript**
3. **Use Git version control**
4. **Use the command line and file navigation**
5. **Develop locally on your computer**
6. **Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages**
7. **OPTIONAL: Buy a custom domain name and have it point to your GitHub Pages website**
